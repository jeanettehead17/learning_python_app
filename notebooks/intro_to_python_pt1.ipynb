      "\n",
      "Welcome to the Ann Arbor PyLadies/Girl Develop It Detroit Intro to Python class! You're going to learn the basics of Python programming while also learning to build a simple Hangman game. It'll be a fun way to show what you've learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can access this page at any time, and I'll distribute the link in class. This is part 1 of 2. For the scripts used in class, you can go to https://github.com/A2PyLadies/a2pyladies-pythonintro/tree/master/scripts to check them out and/or download them.\n",

      "\n",
      "The number one priority is that you have a good time learning Python! If you have questions at any time, please don't hesitate to raise your hand. We'll have several people walking around the room to help you out if you need it. This page will help you follow along.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is programming? Programming is teaching the computer to do a task. A program is made up of lines of code in one or more files, each of which solve part of the overall task. A programming language like Python, which is very readable by humans, has to be translated into a form that the machine can understand. Python uses an interpreter to do the translating.\n",
      "\n",
      "## About Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is a powerful programming language that's good for beginners to learn because of its readable, clean syntax. It can be used for a variety of things like data analysis, web development, software, and game development. One advantage of using Python is that it's easy to develop things quickly. There are two versions of Python: 2.7.x and 3.3.x. For the purposes of this workshop, we'll use Python 2.7.\n",

      "## Installing Python and a text editor\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's set up our computer for Python programming! The first thing you'll need it Python itself. If you use Mac OS X or Linux, you're in luck: Python comes with those operating systems, so you can skip this step. \n",
      "\n",
      "To install on Windows, go here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/ You'll most likely want to install either this one: **Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.7.6) (sig)** or this one: **Windows x86 MSI program database (2.7.6) (sig)**.
